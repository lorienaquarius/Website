            <p>Hello! You've made it to my website. My name is Lorien Aquarius. I am a computer systems engineering student
                at Carleton University. I obviously enjoy programming, and playing video games. Outside of school, I enjoy playing
                sports such as soccer and volleyball, as well as playing the double and electric bass. I also enjoy cuddling with my
                dog and playing Pok√©mon.

                <p>This is my dog Coco! She is a very cute dog, she's about 10 years old now. However she will 
                    forever be a puppy and spends her days going on long walks and getting super excited over 
                    nothing. I miss her while I'm at school, and she's always the brightest face when I come back. 
                    She is a beautiful Cocker Spanial + Poodle mix who doesn't shed so she is constantly fluffy.
