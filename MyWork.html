            <p>I am completely interested in tech. I started off building my first computer when I was 14, and have built several other computers
                for some friends since then. The top computer I have ever built is on display here. I was on my school's FRC robotics team for 2 years,
                one of which was being the executive leader of the programming team. I helped to program what would eventually be the code used
                to get our team to 14th in the province, while placing 4th at our regional tournament.

            <p>This is a picture of everyone on my robotics team, in 2019 in front of our maintenance pit. This was where we would make repairs
                on our robot after a match, discuss strategy, and coordinate with other teams. There were around 40 people form our team at this event,
                from the ~60 total people on the team.
